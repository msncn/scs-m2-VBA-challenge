# scs-VBA-challenge

In this challenge, we're asked to loop through all stocks for one year in sheet, organize data and output the requested information, and then to loop through every sheet in the workbook.

## Instructions

* **1.** Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following.

  * The `Ticker` symbol
  
  * `Yearly Change` from the open price at the begining of the given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  
  * The `Percent Change` from the open price at the begining of the given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  
  * The `Total Stock Volume`

* **2.** Use conditional functioning to highlight the positive change in green and negative change in red

* **3.** Find the `Greatest & Increase`,  the `Greatest % Decrease`, and the `Greatest Total Volume`.

* **4.** Loop the entire worksheet and make sure the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet.

## How to run it

If you go to the `Developer` tab on the top and choose Macros, open the script and run it. Once it's finish running the script, there will be a message box showing `Complete`.
